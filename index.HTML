<P>The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a worldwide information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet . Often referred to simply as the Web . This term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but is strictly a different concept. The web is just one service that works on the Internet, such as e-mail . However, since 1993, the web has occupied the absolute position of the Internet structure.

Internet in the HTTP protocol , hypertext , HTML , using the format, etc. should also say the transmission system for exchanging pictures and text.</p>
